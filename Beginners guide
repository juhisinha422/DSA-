Data Structures Roadmap for Beginners:

✅ Phase 0: Prerequisites (1–2 weeks)

Before touching Data Structures, ensure your programming fundamentals are solid. If you already know these, quickly revise them.

📌 Topics

✅ Basic syntax (loops, conditionals, functions, I/O)

✅ Variables & data types

✅ Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical)

✅ Arrays basics

✅ String basics

✅ Time Complexity (Big O notation introduction)
