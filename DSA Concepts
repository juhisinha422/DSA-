LinkedLists?
- Used them to build automated workflows that start with a trigger and execute a set of actions or could trigger another workflow!

HashMaps?
- Used them to optimise a function from O(nÂ²) complexity to O(n) by creating a map of items!

Graphs?
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) are the building blocks of Apache Airflow - an open-source ETL tool for data engineering!

DFS?
- Used it to recursively traverse the folders and files to import the classes into a list and initialize them at startup!
